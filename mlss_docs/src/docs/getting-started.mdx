We at Microsoft are so thrilled to support you with this year's ML Summer School @ ETH Zurich.

This page will help you to get the most out of it.
You will find things to learn and do **before**, **during** and **after** the summer school.

## Before the summer school

We'll be doing a virtual "live" webinar the week before the school.
We will record the webinar and share the video with you afterwards.
