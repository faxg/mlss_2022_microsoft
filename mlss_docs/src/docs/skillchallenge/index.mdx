Cloud Skills challenges is a gamified way to learn skills.
We curated a collection of free learning materials that will prepare you for using Azure Cloud for Machine Learning and Data Science.

It's the perfect self-learning preparation before we'll do our tech session.

## How does it work?

Simply go to the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/mlss2022-skills-challenge) and click on
**"Join the Challenge"** (you'll need to login to Microsoft Learn with your account).

- **Challenge Start:** July 17th
- **Challenge End:** August 5th

You have time to complete the challenge up until before the Summer School starts.

There will be a **Leaderboard** where you can see how you rank against your peers.

## What's next after I'm done?

The Sills challenge not only prepares you well for the MLSS, but also is a great first step
for some valuable **Microsoft certification** exams.
If you didn't complete everything, don't worry - we're still doing our live prep [webinar](/getting-started).

Next step is to learn more about the Microsoft certifications.
After going through the challenge, it shouldn't be too hard - and it's free for students and teachers !
